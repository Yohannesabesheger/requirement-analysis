# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

## 📌 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical process in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.

It serves as the foundation for all future stages of development by clearly defining:

- **What** the system should do (Functional Requirements)
- **How well** the system should perform (Non-functional Requirements)

---

## 🎯 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in the SDLC due to the following reasons:

### ✅ Clarity and Shared Understanding
Ensures that stakeholders and the development team are on the same page about the system’s objectives and functions.

### ✅ Accurate Project Planning
Allows for more precise estimation of time, budget, and resources.

### ✅ Reduced Rework and Cost
Minimizes misunderstandings and the need for costly changes later in the project.

### ✅ Better Design and Development
Provides a clear blueprint for developers to build the system correctly the first time.

### ✅ Effective Testing
Serves as the basis for creating test cases and ensures that the system meets the expected requirements.

### ✅ Easier Change Management
Helps in assessing the impact of any changes made during the development cycle.

## 🧩 Types of Requirements

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Functional Requirements** | Describe what the system should do | Login, user registration, data processing |
| **Non-functional Requirements** | Define how the system performs | Performance, scalability, usability |
| **Business Requirements** | High-level business needs | Improve customer retention |
| **User Requirements** | What the user expects from the system | Search, export data |
| **System Requirements** | Technical and infrastructure needs | Database, server OS, APIs |

## 🛠️ Steps in Requirement Analysis

1. **Requirement Elicitation**  
   Techniques: Interviews, surveys, observations, workshops, prototyping

2. **Requirement Analysis**  
   Analyze for clarity, feasibility, consistency, and priority

3. **Requirement Specification**  
   Document requirements using SRS, use case diagrams, flowcharts, etc.

4. **Requirement Validation**  
   Ensure correctness, completeness, and alignment with business goals

5. **Requirement Management**  
   Track and manage changes throughout the development lifecycle

## 📉 Risks of Poor Requirement Analysis

- Project delays
- Increased cost
- Unsatisfied users
- Scope creep
- Failure to meet business goals

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Engage stakeholders early and continuously
- Use visual tools (UML, flowcharts, wireframes)
- Prioritize requirements (MoSCoW method)
- Keep documentation clear, concise, and version-controlled
- Validate requirements regularly with all stakeholders

---

## 📘 Conclusion

Requirement Analysis is a foundational process in the SDLC. It ensures that software is built to solve the right problem in the right way. Investing in good requirement analysis leads to successful projects, reduced costs, and satisfied users.
